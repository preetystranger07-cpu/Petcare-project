    <h2>Our Mission and Team</h2>
    <p>
      Pet Care was founded by animal lovers who wanted an affordable, friendly space for pets and owners.
      Our team has experience in animal handling, basic first aid, and customer support.
      We focus on safety, cleanliness, and compassionate treatment. Each pet receives personalized attention
      and a care plan. We continually update our practices by learning from vets and pet care professionals.
